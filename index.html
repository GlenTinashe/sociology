    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A pathway-centric, interactive dashboard. The user first selects a primary career goal (NGO, M&E, Climate). The UI then dynamically displays a recommended, multi-stage learning sequence for that path as an interactive visual flow. This is more user-friendly than a long, static report. It includes a cross-cutting skills visualizer (radar chart) and a filterable course catalog to support non-linear exploration. This structure prioritizes user choice and guided discovery, making the dense information from the report digestible and actionable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Pathways are interactive cards to guide user choice. The learning sequence is a custom HTML/CSS diagram for visual clarity over a table. In-demand skills are shown on a Chart.js Radar Chart to visualize the "T-shaped professional" concept and show relationships between skills. A simple filterable table serves as a comprehensive reference for all courses. This mix of custom diagrams, charts, and interactive tables makes the content engaging and easy to navigate. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
